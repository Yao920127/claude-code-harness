# 工作階段投影

[English](session-projection.md) | 中文

工作階段投影 seam 是一項[能力 seam](../capability-seams.zh.md)：領域 host 外掛經由它向用戶端載體供給按工作階段的日誌派生狀態的目前全量值；三方分別是 Service Definition 與註冊表（[dsh-session-projection](../../packages/session/session-projection)，`ctx.sessionProjections`）、領域貢獻方（每個領域註冊一個純單元）與載體（[dsh-session-controller](../../packages/api/session-controller) 的歷史尾頁與 `session/projection` 推送幀）。它是一項可選能力，不屬於 agent loop（智慧代理迴圈）主幹。框架負責驅動，領域負責計算：註冊表只訂閱一次 `session/event`，並把每個已提交事件摺疊進每個單元；領域不持有任何訂閱，用戶端也從不折疊領域事件——它們收到的是成品值。設計權威：[session-projection RFC](../../.agents/notes/proposed/architecture/2026-07-27-session-projection-and-command-log.zh.md)；驅動、快取與變更流約定：[包 README](../../packages/session/session-projection/README.zh.md)。

## 投影單元

`SessionProjectionStateMap` 是 host 側摺疊狀態的 merge-extensible 型別表，`SessionProjectionMap` 則繼續表示用戶端可見的全量值。領域為每個狀態 key 貢獻一個 `ProjectionDefinition`；`wire` 塊使該 key 對用戶端可見，渲染歸 slot 體系管，永遠不歸本層：

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One domain's state-driven computation unit: a pure synchronous fold plus
 * declarations and an optional client view — never an opaque getter. The framework drives
 * `apply` on every committed session event; the domain holds no
 * subscriptions and owns only the computation. All functions MUST be
 * synchronous (an async unit would tear the carriers' consistency cut), and
 * `state` MUST be plain JSON (the persisted-cache precondition).
 */
interface ProjectionDefinition<
  K extends keyof SessionProjectionStateMap,
  S extends SessionProjectionStateMap[K] = SessionProjectionStateMap[K],
> {
  /** The projection key this unit owns (its `SessionProjectionStateMap` entry). */
  key: K
  /** Validates persisted state before it seeds a fold. */
  stateSchema: ZodType<S>
  /**
   * State for the empty log and its immutable Session metadata.
   * @param header - immutable metadata for the Session being projected.
   * @param inheritedEventCount - exact fork-inherited prefix length.
   * @returns the initial state.
   */
  init(header: SessionHeader, inheritedEventCount: SessionLogOffset): NoInfer<S>
  /**
   * Pure transition: previous state + one committed event → next state. A
   * unit uninterested in an event MUST return the same state reference — an
   * unchanged reference (`Object.is`) produces zero downstream work.
   * @param state - the state covering all prior events.
   * @param event - the next committed session event.
   * @returns the next state (same reference when the event is not the unit's).
   */
  apply(state: NoInfer<S>, event: SessionEvent): NoInfer<S>
  /** Client view. Omit for host-only units. */
  wire?: K extends keyof SessionProjectionMap ? {
    /** Validates the wire payload before it leaves the host. */
    viewSchema: ZodType<SessionProjectionMap[K]>
    /**
     * State → wire payload (the read-side projection). The live drive keeps
     * the two latest raw results and compares them with `Object.is`; an
     * object-valued view must reuse its reference to suppress publication
     * across internal-only state changes.
     * @param state - the current state.
     * @returns the whole current value for this unit's key.
     */
    view(state: NoInfer<S>): SessionProjectionMap[K]
  } : never
  /**
   * Persisted-cache invalidation version: bump whenever the serialized state fields or the
   * fold semantics change, so persisted `(sessionId, key, ver, seq, val)`
   * rows from an older unit are discarded instead of being forward-applied
   * into garbage. Non-negative integer.
   */
  stateVersion: number
}
```

每個對外投影值都是完整讀模型。源事件可以攜帶完整值，也可以攜帶領域擁有的操作；單元的確定性 `apply` 負責回放，checkpoint 加前向 tail replay 會重建出同一狀態。

## 快照與變更流

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One consistent read cut over every registered client-visible unit for one session.
 * `asOfSeq` is the shared watermark — the seq of the last event every value
 * reflects (`-1` for an empty log).
 */
interface ProjectionSnapshot {
  /** Seq of the last event the values reflect; -1 for an empty log. */
  asOfSeq: SessionSeqCursor
  /** Whole current client value per registered key. */
  values: Partial<SessionProjectionMap>
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Change-feed listener: one unit's raw `view` result changed by `Object.is`
 * for one session. `value` is the schema-validated output; `seq` is the
 * unit's watermark at emission (the seq of the event that caused the change).
 */
type ProjectionChangeListener = (
  session: Session,
  key: Extract<keyof SessionProjectionMap, string>,
  value: unknown,
  seq: SessionSeq,
) => void
```

`snapshot(session)` 完全同步：載體在切出頁面切片的同一 tick 內讀取它，因此 `asOfSeq` 使兩次讀取使用同一個序號。它只返回用戶端檢視，並在返回前透過各單元的 `viewSchema` 驗證。`stateOf(session, key)` 可在不計算無關檢視的情況下讀取一份即時 host 狀態；呼叫方不得修改這一借用引用。state 引用變化時，註冊表計算並快取一次原始 view；只有該結果透過 `Object.is` 判定為變化時才觸發變更流，物件 view 若要在僅內部 state 變化時抑制釋出就必須保留引用。

## 註冊表：`ctx.sessionProjections`

`SessionProjectionRegistry`（[簽名](#ctxsessionprojections--sessionprojectionregistry)）擁有驅動權：一份 `session/event` 訂閱、對每個已註冊單元即時呼叫 `apply`，以及每工作階段每單元的水位線（watermark）cell。cell 惰性建置：在事件流過之後才註冊的單元，或比註冊表更早的工作階段，都在首次觸達（事件或讀取）時從 `init` 出發在記憶體日誌上摺疊。註冊是一個 effect，其 disposer 隨呼叫方 fiber 走：領域外掛解除安裝後，其 key（連同快取的 cell）從後續驅動與快照中消失，用戶端將其讀作能力缺失；key 以不同 `stateVersion` 重複時直接 throw，同版本註冊方則共享一個單元並被計數。領域外掛在 `ctx.inject(['sessionProjections'], …)` 下注冊，因此不帶註冊表的 headless 組裝完全不受影響。

### `ctx.sessionProjectionCache` — `SessionProjectionCache`

The persisted projection cache service. Opens the `session_projcache` domain at init, checkpoints live sessions on a throttled write-behind (count/interval triggers from Config) plus three mandatory points — session creation, `turn/end`, and session disposal (the live-to-cold moment) — and serves the cached rows for a session header. Every durable write is fail-soft: failures log a warning and the cache self-heals on the next write.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * The zero-I/O listing read: whole values viewed straight from the stored
 * rows (version-matching keys only) of the record bound to the caller's
 * lifecycle. The header is the only identity witness a listing holds, so
 * this face matches the lifecycle identity (`formatVersion`, `createdAt`,
 * `cwd`, `isSeeded`) and not the inherited cut: within one format
 * generation the cut is fixed at fork time, so it distinguishes no
 * lifecycle the other fields do not, and a viewed value never seeds a fold.
 * The view is as stale as the last durable checkpoint but never wrong and
 * never from an unrelated log. Its `asOfSeq` is the lowest watermark among
 * the served rows: the stored record's own position, which the header
 * cannot relate to the log the caller later opens. The Session list
 * therefore labels the block as cached, and the client lets every value the
 * connected Session produces supersede it whatever this number says.
 * @param meta - the listed session's header (identity witness; no log read).
 * @param keys - optional projection keys required by the caller's audience.
 * @returns the viewed block, or `undefined` when no usable row exists for
 *   this lifecycle at the current Session format.
 */
cachedSnapshot( meta: SessionHeader, keys?: readonly Extract<keyof SessionProjectionMap, string>[], ): ProjectionSnapshot | undefined

/**
 * Read only a predecessor checkpoint's title as a zero-I/O listing hint.
 *
 * The authoritative Session header supplies the lifecycle identity. A cache
 * checkpoint can lag that log but cannot lead it because writes flush the
 * log first, so a matching predecessor title is a genuine (possibly stale)
 * fact from this Session. The registry still requires the current title
 * projection's row version and schema. No other predecessor projection is
 * exposed: format normalization can change their current meaning, and the
 * {@link cachedSnapshot} / hydration paths continue to reject them.
 * @param meta - authoritative listed Session header.

### `ctx.sessionProjections` — `SessionProjectionRegistry`

`ctx.sessionProjections`: the projection unit table and its drive. The service subscribes to `session/event` once; every committed event passes every registered unit's `apply` (eager drive). A changed state reference computes the next client view; the change feed is notified only when its raw result changes by `Object.is`. Cells build lazily — a unit registered after events flowed, or a session older than the registry, folds `init` over the in-memory log on first touch (event or read). Registration is an effect (disposer rides the calling fiber): an unloaded domain plugin's key disappears from snapshots and clients read it as capability absence. A host reader either declares `sessionProjections` in its plugin `inject` or fails explicitly when the registry or required key is absent. Contributors may preserve optional registration through `ctx.inject(['sessionProjections'], ...)`. Registrants sharing a key share one unit and are counted: the same tool package mounted in N agent presets registers N times, and the key survives until the last one unloads.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register one domain's unit. The registration is an effect on the calling
 * context's fiber: disposing the fiber (or calling the returned disposer)
 * removes the key — and the unit's cached cells — from subsequent drives

 * @returns the exact disposer that unregisters this unit.
